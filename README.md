Customized maxLeft, minLeft, maxTop, minTop properties.
If you specify the coordinates, the DraggableView will not be able to move out.

And, "move" event listener added.
ex. draggableView.addEventListener('move', function(e){});



...Axis? I did not test :P

## How to install the module:

1. Create a new property in tiapp.xml:
```
    <module version="1.0" platform="iphone">ti.draggable</module>
```
2. Copy the zip file to the root of your project.
3. require the module in your application:
```
Ti.Draggable = require('ti.draggable');
```
4. Clean your build directory
5. Build.

## How to use the module
To create a draggable view, simple create it like so:
```
   var view = Ti.Draggable.createView({ _props });
```

Treat this view as a normal Ti.UI.View, but keeping in mind that this view has the draggable properties already build in; if nothing is specified, it will be draggable all over the screen.

## Properties:

### These will make the view slide to their coresponding positions

* maxLeft: (int)
* minLeft: (int)
* maxTop: (int)
* minTop: (int)

### This will make the view stick to it's axis:

* axis: (String) "x" or "y"

## Event Listeners

1. start: will fire on touch start
2. top: will fire on when the view has finished moving
